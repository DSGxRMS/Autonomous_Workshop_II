Grid with 4-connected, unit-cost moves. 
Obstacles: vertical wall at col 7 with gaps (rows 6,16); horizontal wall along row 12, cols 4–24, door at col 14. 
Participants discover route; optimal ≈44 steps. 
Weighted variant: grass band rows 10–14 (cost 3), bridges at cols 8/16; extra walls at cols 7/17 enforce trade-offs.
