Quick sanity notes (so you can explain it in 60 seconds)

Legend: 0 = free, 1 = wall.

Walls:

A vertical wall at column 7 (0-indexed) with gaps at rows 6 and 16.

A horizontal wall across row 12 from columns 4..24 with a door at column 14.

Movement: 4-connected (up/down/left/right), uniform cost = 1.

Why this works for beginners: They’ll naturally discover they must

reach the upper gap to cross right,

then find the door at (14,12) to pass the horizontal wall,

and head to the goal.

Reference optimal path length (for your metrics sheet): ≈ 44 steps (4-connected, uniform cost).

Don’t tell them upfront; use it to check their outputs.

If you’re happy with this, say “lock it” and we’ll move to Exercise-1 spec (what they must do, acceptance checks, and the exact on-screen UI prompts) — still no code.


How this teaches the lesson

Legend: 0 = road (cost 1), 1 = wall (BLOCK), 2 = grass (cost 3).

Design: rows 10–14 are a grass band (costly) across the map.
Two narrow road “bridges” at columns 8 and 16 pierce the band (those cells are 0), so students must choose:

shorter distance through grass (expensive), or

a slight detour to a bridge (longer in steps, cheaper total cost).

Extra friction: vertical walls at columns 7 and 17 with a few gaps force real decisions about which bridge is reachable.
